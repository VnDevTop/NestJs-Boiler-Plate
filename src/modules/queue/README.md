# Queue

Background work: mail now, notifications and retention next. A request enqueues
and returns; nothing here runs inside a request.

## Two drivers, one implementation of the work

`InProcessDispatcher` and `BullMqDispatcher` both satisfy `JobQueue`, and both
hand the job to the same `ProcessorRouter`, which calls the same
`MailProcessor`. What is duplicated is the retry _loop_, because a queue backend
has one and a plain process does not. The retry _decisions_ come from
`retry.policy.ts` in both cases, and both read the numbers from `queue.config.ts`,
so enabling the queue does not change how many attempts a job gets.

This matters more than it looks. The in-process path is the one nobody exercises
in development when the queue is on, and the one that runs during a redis outage.
Two implementations of a send is how a bug reaches production through the path
that was never tested.

## Why deduplication sits around the processor

A queue is at-least-once: a job can be delivered twice, and that happens at
_execution_, not at enqueue. A check in `enqueue` would never see the second
delivery.

| Outcome                       | What happens to the key                            |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| First delivery                | `SET NX` succeeds, work runs                       |
| A redelivery racing the first | `SET NX` fails, work is skipped                    |
| Retryable failure             | The key is **released**, so the retry can claim it |
| Success                       | Held until the TTL                                 |
| Permanent failure             | Held, the job is finished                          |

Releasing on a retryable failure is the load-bearing part. Holding the key would
make the retry skip itself, bullmq would record success, and the mail would never
be sent — with no error anywhere. `dedupe.guard.spec.ts` asserts that release.

**A redis outage fails open.** `setIfAbsent` answers `null` when it cannot ask,
and the job runs anyway. A duplicate is cheaper than a lost email.

The key lifetime is `retryWindowMs()`, the sum of every wait the retry budget
allows. A key that expired mid-retry would let a redelivery through as a new job,
which is the duplicate it exists to prevent.

## What the in-process dispatcher does that a queue would

- A concurrency limit per queue, so six maintenance jobs cannot occupy the pool
  that mail needs. `queue.config.ts` gives each queue its own number.
- A backlog bound of `concurrency * 50`. Beyond that it drops the job and logs an
  error. The backlog is heap: a traffic spike that outruns the provider would
  otherwise take the process down.
- Tracked retry timers, cleared on shutdown. An untracked `setTimeout` keeps the
  event loop alive and hangs the suite.

## BullMQ is optional

`bullmq` is resolved through `loadOptional`, so it is never a static import: a
bare import is resolved at build time and a deployment without the package would
fail to start rather than fall back. It is a dev dependency here so the adapter can
be tested against the real thing; a production deployment that does not enable the
queue does not need it.

A permanent failure is signalled by throwing an error named `UnrecoverableError`.
bullmq checks `err instanceof UnrecoverableError || err.name === '...'`, so the
name is enough and the class does not have to be imported.

## Cron entries do not live here

There is no `@Cron` decorator in this module. The only recurring work is the
retention job, which arrives with Phase 16. A cron entry today would enqueue a job
that no processor claims, which the router reports as a permanent failure and the
dead-letter list then fills with every night.

When the entries land they will use `@nestjs/schedule` rather than a queue
backend, so they keep firing when redis is down — which is when the database most
needs cleaning.

## The dead-letter list is redis, not a table

It is operational data, read by a human at 3am, worthless after a few days. A
Postgres table would mean something Phase 16 has to remember to purge. In redis the
TTL does the cleanup. Trimmed to 500 entries, and every write is best effort: when
redis is why the job failed, the log line is the only record, and that is
deliberate.
