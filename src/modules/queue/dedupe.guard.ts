/**
 * Stops the same work being done twice.
 *
 * ## Why this sits around the processor and not at `enqueue`
 *
 * A queue is at-least-once: a job can be delivered more than once, and that
 * happens at *execution*, not at enqueue. A check in `enqueue` would never see the
 * second delivery, so the duplicate it was meant to prevent would still be sent.
 * The guard has to run where the work runs.
 *
 * ## Why the key is released on a retryable failure
 *
 * The obvious implementation, claim the key and hold it, silently breaks retries:
 *
 * ```text
 * attempt 1  SET NX succeeds, mail fails with a timeout
 * attempt 2  SET NX fails because the key is still there -> skipped
 *            bullmq sees a clean return -> job marked done
 *            the mail is never sent
 * ```
 *
 * The user gets no email, no error, and no entry anywhere. So a retryable failure
 * releases the key, and only a success or a permanent failure keeps it.
 *
 * ## Why a redis outage fails open
 *
 * `setIfAbsent` answers `null` when redis could not be asked. That is treated as
 * permission to proceed. The alternative loses a real email because redis blinked;
 * the cost here is a possible duplicate, which a mail client collapses anyway.
 *
 * ## Where the duplicate actually comes from
 *
 * A redelivery racing a first attempt is the case this exists for: two workers,
 * one job, two emails. The key is claimed before the work and held until the TTL,
 * so the loser of the race skips.
