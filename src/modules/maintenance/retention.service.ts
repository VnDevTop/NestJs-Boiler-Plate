 * How many rows a `DELETE ... RETURNING` actually removed.

 * carrying `RETURNING` it returns the tuple `[entities, affected]`, so the array
 * length is always 2 no matter how many rows went. Measured against Postgres:
 * one row, two rows and a no-op all came back with a length of 2, and the real
 * counts sat in the second element as 1, 2 and 0.
 *
 * Reading the length instead costs twice over, in opposite directions. With a
 * batch size equal to the tuple length the loop never ends, because a full batch
 * is never shorter than the batch size, and the run deletes until the timeout.
 * With any larger batch size the first statement comes back looking short, the
 * loop stops after one batch, and a table needing twenty batches is reported as
 * clean while it still holds nineteen of them. Both are silent: the log says the
 * run finished.
 *
 * Falls back to the array length only if the tuple is absent, which keeps the
 * helper usable against a runner that does hand back rows.

/**
 * Runs the retention policy: deletes rows that can no longer be useful, in

 *
 * Three decisions shape the whole class.
 *
 * A run is safe to repeat. There is no lock and no claim table, so two runs can
 * overlap and a run that dies halfway is finished by the next one. Rows are only
 * ever removed once they are already past their age, so the worst a duplicate
 * run costs is a slightly later cleanup.
 *
 * A target that fails does not stop the run. Retention is housekeeping; a single
 * renamed column should cost the operator one skipped table, not a week of
 * uncollected data across every table.
 *
 * The run stops on the first timeout rather than finishing the batch in
 * progress. A timeout here is nearly always a lost database connection rather
 * than a full disk, since rows are removed continuously, and a lost connection
 * makes the remaining batches pointless anyway.
