 * than with the `@Cron` decorator, because the decorator needs its expression as
 * a literal at the moment the class is defined. `RETENTION_SCHEDULE` is therefore
 * a value this reads, not something baked into the compiled output, and changing
 * it does not need a rebuild of the decorator's arguments.
 *
 * It enqueues rather than calling the service, which is the point of the whole
 * queue abstraction: `JOB_QUEUE` is BullMQ when redis is configured and an
 * in-process promise when it is not, so this fires either way. A retention job
 * gated on redis being up is a retention job that skips exactly the outage where
 * the database needs it.
